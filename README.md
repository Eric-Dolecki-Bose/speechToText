# speechToText
A template Swift project that uses a button to show speech to text transcription from a microphone and fills a text view as it proceeds. 

This can be used as the basis for Bose AR hardware that contains a microphone. The project uses a button, but a double-tap or another gesture could kick off microphone recording. Just a little helper project. 

You can use a fuzzy string matching algorithm to determine intent/input. Something like fuse-swift [fuse-swift](https://github.com/krisk/fuse-swift).
